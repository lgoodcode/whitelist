## Project Description

This is my first real website project I'm currently working on. I'm working on my Typescript,
React, Redux state management, and design skills. I am also trying to get used to proper
version control with Git. I'm trying to keep the history as clean as possible using a
seperate branch to perform work on and the squash merging it into main with a revised
commit message of all the squashed commits.
