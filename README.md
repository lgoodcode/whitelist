# UPDATE

The person I was building this site for had abandoned the project so I am leaving it in the
current state, after making some fixes so that it is viewable without any glaring problems.

## Tech

This project is derived from my [initial-project](https://github.com/lgoodcode/initial-project) respository, where 
I used it as a shell and gutted out any project specific code. All the details are included in that project's
README file.

## Backend

The project is split into front-end and back-end repositories. The back-end, [whitelist-backend](https://github.com/lgoodcode/whitelist-backend)
controls all API calls and serves data from a database. More details can be found in the repositories README.

## About this site

This is my first real website project I'm currently working on. I'm working on my Typescript,
React, Redux state management, and design skills. I am also trying to get used to proper
version control with Git. I'm trying to keep the history as clean as possible using a
seperate branch to perform work on and the squash merging it into main with a revised
commit message of all the squashed commits.
